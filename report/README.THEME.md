## Getting Started
The best way to start with photon THEME is with a photon STARTER project. Checkout the repo here:

https://github.com/photon-platform/photon

Current version of this theme has some dependencies on  site level configurations. This will be resolved in a future version.

See the theme configuration section for more on the STARTER project:
https://github.com/photon-platform/photon#theme-configuration

I highly recommend reviewing the excellent material on GRAV Documentation site:
https://learn.getgrav.org/themes


## Articles in Pages

Photon takes a content first approach to development.

We develop our content as a set of hierarchical data.

An **Article** is a node in our dataset.

A **Page** is the template document that structures the content of one or more articles along with components to provide context and navigation.





## Templates
see README in templates folder for more about the concpets for the TWIG template files:

## Styles
