## bash config
much of this repo is about source files and scripts to facilitate common actions from the command line.

### home script
symlink the following to current user's home folder
- .bashrc
- .bash_profile

### bash_prompt

custom prompt config

shows user, machine, time, directory, and git branch & status (if available)



## site management scripts and functions



### `sites`
all sites are created in `~/SITES`

the `sites` command alone will cd to the folder and list the current sites



### `sites status`
navigate to the `~/SITES` folder

run git status on all the sites in the folder

TODO: create an option for checking submodules as well

### `sites <foldername>`
the user folder in each site created by photon contains a `.photon` source file with project specific environment variables and aliases to facilitate project management from the commandline.

typing `sites` followed by the site folder name, will `cd` to the `user` folder of the site and load its `.photon` source file.
it also prints the title of the site from the command line.

once you have this site context, you can use the following commands

- `th` - jump to photon theme submodule
- `ch` - jump to child theme folder
- `pg` - jump to `pages` folder
  - `pg new` - create new page from the current folder
- `pl` - jump to plugin folder
  - also has its one parameters for managing photon plugins
- `us` - return to user folder
- `local` - open local site in browser
- `admin` - open local admin page in browser
- `server` - open server page in browser.

and more...

## file sync routines

when in a site context at the commandline

- `sync push all` - rsync to server to synchronize all local project files, including grav, to the server
- `sync push user` - sync just the user folder

## git helpers

`gsub` - perform actions to manage submodules
